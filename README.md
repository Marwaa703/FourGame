# It Takes Four

**It Takes Four** is an engaging two-player connection game where the goal is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs before your opponent does. In single-player mode, you can challenge an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, which analyzes the game board and makes strategic decisions to either block your moves or secure a win.

Built with **React Native**, **Expo**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**, **It Takes Four** offers a responsive and enjoyable experience on both Android and iOS devices.

## Game Rules

### Objective:
The objective of the game is to form a line of four of your discs, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. 

### How to Play:
- **Two-Player Mode**: Two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid.
- **Single-Player Mode (Computer vs Player)**: In single-player mode, you play as **Red discs**, and the computer plays as **Yellow discs**. The computer AI, powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, makes strategic moves to either block your winning moves or set up its own win.
- Players take turns tapping on the column where they want to drop their disc.
- The disc will fall to the next available space within the selected column.

### Win Condition:
Be the first to form a line of four discs in a rowâ€”either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
